# quiz-maker-api
A simple sample project that I used as back-end to practice with front-end that I learn.

This project already connected to database it has connection string in **appsetting.json**, you can clone it and customize it to learn more about **.Net Core**.
I will not say this is a good archecture project but I hope it will help you to understand more about the use of OOP concept and cleaner code.
