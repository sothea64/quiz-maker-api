# quiz-maker-api
A simple sample project that I used as back-end to practice with front-end that I learn.

I have done basic things for this project such as:
  - Database connection, along with commit transaction
  - Basic JWT authentication
  - Basic clean architecture
  - Some basic CRUD operation
  - Basic dependency injection and HTTP context accesing
  - Swagger configuration
  - Error handling middleware so you can handle exception easier and more effecient
    with different type of exception if you want to

I will not say this project is the best approach as it is not my intention, but I hope it will inspire someone 
to learn more and find better approach.

Cheer :)
